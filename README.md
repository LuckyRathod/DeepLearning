### ANN Model 

##### Problem Statement 
A Bank contains information about its employees. Information such as Name,ID,Credit score,Balance,Estimated Salary,Exited etc.These Bank has been seeing unusual Churn Rates(Employees that leave company) in last 6 months .So these Bank wants to understand that what's the main reason behind these and want to address it.So I have created a Artificial Neural Network(ANN) model which gets trained on these dataset.And Bank will use these model on New Observation (Other Employees) to get the probability that whether the employee will leave bank or not.

**Results**

Model was trained on 8000 observation of Employees and was tested on new 2000 observation of Employees
Out of 2000 observations 
- 1686 ->Correct Predictions
- 314 ->Incorrect Predictions
