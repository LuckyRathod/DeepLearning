    "### T23 - Convolution neural network vs Human Brain\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever your inputs are in form of Images/Video Frames we use Convolution neural Network.With help of CNN we can do Image Classification,Object Detection,Face Detection,Object Classification and many more\n",

    "#### How image recognition is done in Human brain ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Human brain is divided into 4 parts . One of the part is Cerebral cortex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cerebral Cortex contains\n",
    "1. Visual Cortex -- It is responsible for seeing images and extracting information from image.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Whenever you see a cat through eyes, It reaches to cerebral coretex via neurons . In Cerebral cortex there is Visual cortex which contains multiple layers (v1,v2,v3,v4,v5.v6).\n",
    "\n",
    "v1 -- It is responsible for finding edges of image (Ear Edge of cat)\n",
    "v2 -- Some more information of cat will be gathered in these layer also (Is there any other object along with cat)\n",
    "v4 -- Will extract some information from face\n",
    "Similarly all layers v3,v4,v5,v6 will extract some infomation from images . All these information will pass from one layer to another layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "At final after these extraction of information from image we will be able to recognize the image"
